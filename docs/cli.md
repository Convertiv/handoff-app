# Handoff CLI

The Handoff cli allows you to interact with your Figma file and Handoff app
via the command line. It allows you to run handoff in any folder with
no other configuration or setup.  

## Interacting with Figma
The CLI will allow you to fetch all data from Figma, build the documentation
app and run a local dev site. For these use the build, fetch, and serve commands
documented below.  

## Configuring a handoff project
The CLI will allow you to build the various kinds of configurations that you
will need for interacting with Figma. Handoff has sane configuration defaults
but the various kinds of configurations can be tailored or extended.

Handoff has 4 configuration files - 

`handoff.config.json` - Defines the general handoff configuration.
`pages` - Markdown files that will create or customize pages in the documentation
app
`exportables` - JSON schemas for each component in your figma file that you
want to pull into handoff.
`integration` - scss mappings and html templates for making it easy to map
handoff tokens to your frontend framework.

The CLI exposes two ways to manage the config - `make` and `eject`. 

__Eject__ commands will take the default configuration and eject them into
the current working directory. If you customize these configurations, then run 
handoff commands in that directory, these configs will be executed.
__Make__ commands will generate a boilerplate configuration in the current
working directory. This is useful for extending handoff for different components
or integrations.
