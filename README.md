transform tokens into dev ready artifacts.

## What Is Handoff?

Handoff is an open source tool for extracting design tokens from the Figma REST
API and building frontend developer documentation from that Figma file. By
automating the design token delivery, Handoff helps to eliminate bottlenecks
between design and development.

Handoff is a collection of 4 javascript tools:

- **Figma Token Extraction** - A framework for extracting
  standardized design foundations and components from Figma.
- **Transformation Pipeline** - A set of transformers for producing SASS, CSS,
  Style Dictionary, and preview snippets from that data.
- **Documentation Web App** - A static, client side, Javascript web app that
  renders live, working previews of your components, tokens and styles.
- **Delivery Tools** - Easy build tooling and CI/CD wrapper that allows
  automation to render and ship the various deliverables as needed.

## How does it work?

Handoff works by extracting design foundations and component data from
[well-formed Figma libraries](https://www.figma.com/file/IGYfyraLDa0BpVXkxHY2tE/Starter-%5BV2%5D?node-id=0%3A1&t=iPYW37yDmNkJBt1t-0),
storing them as JSON, and then transforming them into design tokens. Those
design tokens are published as SASS and CSS variables.

Out of the box, Handoff has native SCSS and CSS maps to connect these tokens to
any site using the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) frontend
framework. If you use another framework, or custom CSS, you can easily write
map files to connect the generated tokens with your site or application.

- [Integrating Tokens](https://www.handoff.com/docs/tokens/integration)
- [Customization](https://www.handoff.com/docs/customization)

Once Handoff extracts design tokens and variables, it builds a statically
generated NextJS application that can be published to the web. This asset
can be hosted on a static webhost (NGINX, s3/Cloudfront, Cloudflare pages
etc).

This pipeline from Figma to the Documentation Web app can be automated via CI/CD
to provide automatic, up-to-date, easily readable developer documentation.

## Handoff is in Beta!

Handoff is Awesome. Handoff is also really new. We're constantly building
new features, and expanding what it can do. We'd love to chat if you have
a use case that isn't quite met.

## Requirements

- A paid Figma account is required to publish the Figma file library
- Node 16+
- NPM 8+

## Get Started

### Figma

1. Open the [Handoff Figma starter](https://www.figma.com/file/IGYfyraLDa0BpVXkxHY2tE/Starter-%5BV2%5D?node-id=0%3A1&t=iPYW37yDmNkJBt1t-0)
   and duplicate this project to your account

2. Publish components to the library

- Click on the Figma logo at the top left
- Click on `Libraries`
- Click on the current file
- Click publish changes

You'll need a developer token if you don't have one already

- Click on the Figma logo in the top left
- Go to `Help and Account`
- Click on `Account Settings`
- Scroll to `Personal Access Token`
- Enter a token name and hit enter
- Note that token for the next steps

## Create a project

- Run `npm install -g handoff-app`
- Create a new directory for your project `mkdir my-new-project`
- In that folder (`cd my-new-project`), run `handoff-app fetch`
- Handoff will prompt for your developer token, and the file id of your figma
  file. The file id can be found in the url of the file -
  https://www.figma.com/file/{file_id}/{slug}
- Start the project `handoff-app start`

This will fetch the latest from your Figma file and it will boot a demo site at
http://localhost:3000

## Test Fetch

- Now go back to your Figma file and change a button color
- Republish the changes to the library. Click on the publish button from the main
  dropdown. You'll see a list of changes that have been made. Clicking publish
  will make those changes available to handoff.
- Back in your project, open a new terminal tab and type `npm run fetch`

Once that runs, your browser should update with the new colors.
